Place Roundy Rainbows font files here to enable the custom display font for the app header.

Current files in this repo (after normalization):
- RoundyRainbows.woff2 (present — preferred)
- RoundyRainbows.woff  (present)

If you have additional formats, place them here using these names:
- RoundyRainbows.woff2  (preferred, smaller and better compressed)
- RoundyRainbows.woff
- RoundyRainbows.ttf

How to obtain the font:
- Download/purchase from the source you provided: https://www.fontshmonts.com/display-fonts/roundy-rainbows/
- Ensure you have the right to include the font in this repository (check license).

After placing the files, reload `index.html` in the browser. The header will use the font automatically if the files exist at:
./assets/fonts/RoundyRainbows.woff2 (or .woff)

If you want me to add the actual font file into the repo, upload it here or confirm you have redistribution rights and I will add it for you.
